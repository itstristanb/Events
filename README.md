## Description:
This repository contains a templated c++17 (and up) Event system that allows for clients to attach callbacks to a host 
which then can be invoked at any time. Could also be understood as a 'act, react' pattern.

## Why you should use events:
Real-time applications typically have many things that must be interconnected. Whether its a controller input resulting in the 
player jumping, audio playing etc., or a time sensitive event such as a client entering a queue, this api makes it quick 
and easy to modulate those responses. This project started as a key element to a custom game engine, written in c++.
All player and NPC actions along with the startup and shutting down of systems were driven by these events, making them
crucial for a fast development.

## Supported Platforms:
- The following platforms are supported:
    - Windows: Tested on Windows 10 Professional 64-bit.
    - Linux: Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS


## Requirements:
- C++17 capable compiler:
    - Visual C++ 15 (Visual Studio 2017)
    - Clang 5+
    - GCC 7+

## Documentation:
Current documentation available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/itstristanb/Events/wiki).

## FAQ:
##### How much overhead is from invoking an Event? <br>
Not much, it is the overhead of calling std::function times the number of hooked functions. <br>
(if your application is slow, it is most likely not the events)

##### How do I deal with dll and so static memory ownership? <br>
Create a wrapper function for the event. <br><br> Macro example:
```c++
    //! Creates a function wrapper for an event  
    #define STATIC_EVENT_WRAPPER(TYPE, NAME) static TYPE& Get##NAME() { static TYPE NAME; return NAME; }
    
    // Use example
    STATIC_EVENT_WRAPPER(Event<void()>, ApplicationStart)
    
    int main()
    {
      // ...
      GetApplicationStart().Invoke();
      // ...
      return 0;
    }
```
